1) The average temperatures between June and December shows little differences between the two months with completely different seasons. The temperature for June is 75 degrees and December is 71 degrees. 

2) The maximum temperature still shows little differences with a temperature in June of 85 degrees and in December of 83 degrees. 

3) The minimum shows a difference with the temperatures. The temperature for December being 56 degrees may be slow for business because of the items being sold and to cold for surfing. But then again the standard deviation within the two months, Decembers numbers should show a little more variation.
